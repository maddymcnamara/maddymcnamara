## Projects

### US Open Tennis Match Outcome Prediction
- Built predictive models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors) on historical match data (rank, odds, points) to forecast outcomes.
- Implemented feature engineering with difference metrics and optimized models using train/test split and scaling.
- Achieved ~61% accuracy with KNN.

### Superstore Sales Analysis & Forecasting
- Performed exploratory data analysis on a 50K+ transaction dataset, cleaning and transforming sales, discount, and profit data.
- Built linear regression and KNN models to predict log-transformed sales.
- Identified key performance drivers and visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Reddit Community Analysis: UIUC vs. Michigan
- Applied NLP techniques to analyze and compare discussions from r/UIUC and r/UMich.
- Conducted word frequency analysis, classification modeling (Logistic Regression, ~71% accuracy), and LDA topic modeling.
- Uncovered community-specific themes and language patterns, highlighting informational and emotional support roles of Reddit communities.

### Exploratory Data Analysis & Regression on Student/Car Data
- Performed EDA and predictive modeling on a large car dataset to understand factors influencing selling price.
- Cleaned and prepared data, visualized distributions and correlations.
- Built multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest); Random Forest achieved highest performance (R² ~0.97, RMSE ~1634).
- Analyzed feature importance to identify key drivers such as car age, odometer, and make.
